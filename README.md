## Description

This app fetches information from Punk API [Punk API Documentation](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). It's fetching the maximum number of beers.

some comments:

- Added select all (per page) functionality.
- Added pipe to check custom html.
- Added a selection of items per page to display.
- Added loading while fetching.
- I assumed that the data will always have a key value as string in the form of 'Record<string, any>'.
- The implementation does not use a custom user string for the column headers but it is supported.
- For pagination, 'ngx-pagination' package has been used.
- The selected rows can be seen in the console when entering select mode.

## Improvements

- Add pagination translation.
- Add persistent item selection.
- Add tests.
